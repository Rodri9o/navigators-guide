The idea is simple, but the challenge is huge.

Can we create a book that business customers will use to ensure their success on DigitalOcean?

This book will be focused on the problems customers face with scaling and growing. We outline best practices and explain _why_ they prevent pain points and issues.

Our marketing efforts have primarily been focused on _how_ to accomplish individual concepts, not _why_ to build a holistic structure to prevent pain points and issues.

We hope this book would become a valuable asset that Marketing and Customer Success Managers can share with new business customers to encourage best practices, strengthen multi-attach rates, and ultimately drive revenue.
