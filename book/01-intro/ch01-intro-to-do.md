# DigitalOcean, Customer Success, and You

In the introduction, we said that this book would give you the tools and the understanding you need to run a successful infrastructure on DigitalOcean â€” but what is DigitalOcean, and who are we to tell you what to do?

## What Is DigitalOcean?

<!-- NOTE (Hazel): I summarized this section, leaning heavily on our public-facing copy. We can augment and revise this as we go to tailor it to our audience, but I don't think I can do better than our product marketers at describing our products and company in an appealing way. :) -->

<!-- NOTE (Jon): Do we want to get into IaaS vs PaaS/SaaS and outline what we really offer?  Example graphic: https://support.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/separation-of-responsibilities.png -->

DigitalOcean is a cloud infrastructure provider. Our mission from the start has been to provide an infrastructure experience that development teams love with the features your business needs.

We were founded in 2012, and today we have over 400 employees working out of our headquarters in New York City, our satellite offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Bangalore, India, and remotely across the world.

Because our cloud computing platform was built with simplicity at the forefront, managing infrastructure on DO is easy whether your business is running one virtual machine or ten thousand. Here are some of the products we offer:

* **Droplets** are more than just virtual machines. They are a scalable compute platform with free additional features, like Cloud Firewalls, Monitoring, Floating IP Addresses, and DNS zone hosting, that allow you to easily run production applications.
* **Load Balancers** automatically distribute incoming traffic across your Droplets, enabling you to build more reliable and performant applications by creating redundancy.
* **Volumes** are additional SSD-based block storage devices you can add to your Droplet to suit your database, file storage, application, service, mobile, and backup needs.
* **Spaces** is scalable and simple object storage to store, serve, backup, and archive any amount of web content, images, media, and static files for your web applications.

We move fast; all of these features and product launches were completed in the first six years of the company's history, <!-- TODO: Accurate? --> and our product roadmap promises constant iteration and further expansion of features.

You can find detailed information on [our products](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/) and [current pricing](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/) on digitalocean.com, and we'll keep this book updated in the future as we expand and improve our product offerings.

## Who Are We?

<!-- NOTE (Hazel): I think putting some self-introductions here would make the book feel more personal and approachable. It matches the tone I think you're going for, and it builds trust through transparency. -->

We, the authors, are Fabian Barajas and Jon Schwenn <!-- TODO: Want to include links to your websites/Twitter/whatever? something something personal brand. -->. We're both Solutions Engineers on the Customer Success team at DigitalOcean.

Fabian Barajas was ten years old when he first decided to apply to Starfleet. He knew deep down that passing the entrance exams to the Academy wouldn't be easy. After multiple attempts, Fabian aced his Hyperspace physics test. He currently holds the rank of Lieutenant and is stationed at Starbase 375. He has masted time travel and that is how he is able to impart the wisdom to help deploy robust infrastructure in the twenty first century.<!-- TODO: Fabian intro -->

Jon Schwenn has worked in multiple teams at DigitalOcean since 2015. His prior accomplishments include founding a specialty colocation service that hosted thousands of Mac servers, creating and administering a fairly large automotive internet forum, and building an e-commerece system from scratch with ColdFusion in 2001. It was different times back then. Jon is a Red Hat Certified Architect and has been using Linux professionally since 2003. 

As a business customer, the Customer Success team is your dedicated resource for help with any platform-related issues. We can solve your problems, answer your questions, or connect you with other people at DigitalOcean who work directly on Product or Engineering.

Our whole team is here to support you you: Customer Success Managers are your point of contact for strategic planning and any account concerns, and Customer Success Engineers provide 24x7x365 support through tickets and email, and aim to respond to technical issues within 20 minutes.

We, the Solutions Engineers, help with strategic technical planning discussions, create code examples, and write proof of concept documentation. And sometimes write books.
