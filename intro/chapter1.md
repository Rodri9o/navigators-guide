# Introduction to DigitalOcean

### Ahoy! 
Welcome aboard as we explore DigitalOcean. By the end of this journey, you should have clear concepts and tools to help you run infrastructure successfully on DigitalOcean. This book includes code examples and a repository allowing you to follow along with the material covered. Our goal is to not only introduce and explain individual concepts and tools, but to tie everything together in one cohesive story.

This book is open to users of any skill level. Many of the key take-aways from each chapter will be easy to apply and framed at a high level. We will also dive deep and cover extensive technical details. The code examples and repository will help give you a head start. The main skill-set required for this book is a familiarity with the Linux command line. 

If you need guidance or a quick refresher on Linux command line skills, [there is a series of tutorials on the DigitalOcean Community](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/getting-started-with-linux). The DigitalOcean Community has thousands of easy to follow tutorials as well as listings of open source projects and a question and answer forum.

DigitalOcean was started in 2012 on a mission to deliver simple and scalable infrastructure for developers. In recent years, DigitalOcean has iterated by launching new products and features allowing businesses to successfully deploy and scale to meet their infrastructure needs. Today, there are over 400 employees at DigitalOcean working out of their New York City Headquarters, satellite offices like Cambridge, Massachusetts and Bangalore, India. There is a strong remote culture outside of the office locations as well with nearly 50% of employees working remotely from around the world.

Over 1 million users have deployed over 80 million Droplets on DigitalOcean.  A Droplet is what we call a Virtual Server.  Droplets offer a wide range of compute resources at a great value. Each Droplet is billed at an hourly rate with set monthly cost if the Droplet is active for an entire month. Advanced features can be added to a Droplet at no additional cost. These include Cloud Firewalls, Monitoring, Floating IP Addresses, and DNS zone hosting. 

Expanding from the compute offerings, there are additional services that help with scaling larger web applications.  Load Balancers easily allow multiple Droplets to serve content to users.  Volumes adds Block Storage devices up to 16TB which a Droplet will interpret as a second SSD drive, except that it is served over the network and can be resized. Spaces is an Object Storage solution that starts at flat monthly rate of $5 which includes the ability to store 250GB of files as well as 1TB of outbound data transfer. Any usage past these amounts is billed ultra competitive rates. The files stored in Spaces can be anything from logs, to images, or static web content.  All data in Volumes and Spaces is redundant and there is no single point of failure in the storage clusters.
