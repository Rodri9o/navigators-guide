# Lab Environment Setup

## Our toolbelt

Now that we've discussed digital oceans history and briefly gone over some of the issues will be covering, let's get a better understanding of the tools will be using And how they can be beneficial as you begin to create and manage your infrastructure on DigitalOcean. We'll be using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com), [Terraform-inventory](https://github.com/adammck/terraform-inventory), and [Git](https://git-scm.com) primarily, but in later chapters make use of additional tools like [Packer](https://www.packer.io). For now let's go over what these tools do and how they work together.

#### Terraform

Terraform is a FOSS tool that allows you to easily describe your infrastructure as code. This means you can version control your resources like you would if you were writing a program, allowing you to roll back to a working state if an error occurss. It has a simple declarative syntax ([HCL](https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl)) that you'll be able to understand right away. It allows you to plan your changes for review, and automatically handles infrastructure dependencies for you. Keep in mind that we'll be using Terraform to create our infrastructure (i.e. creating Droplets, floating IPs, Firewalls, Block Storage Volumes, and DigitalOcean Load Balancers). We will not be configuring those resources with Terraform. That's where Ansible comes in.

#### Ansible

Ansible is a configuration management tool. Itâ€™s written in Python and its architecture allows you to create additional plugins, expanding its utility even further. The standard library of modules that ansible comes with is quite extensive. In most cases you won't have to write any modules or additional plugins, but if you need to the option is there. Like Terraform, you can version control your playbooks. Unlike Terraform, a simple change in the configuration of a resource does not require the destruction and recreation of that resource. Another thing to note is that Ansible was created to push configuration changes outward which differs from other configuraiton management tools like  Puppet and Chef. It also doesn't require that an agent be installed on the target nodes beforehand since Ansible leverages simple ssh connections to configure your infrastructure. Ansible does however require knowledge of what endpoints it needs to reach out to. That's normally taken care of with a simple inventory file. Since we're using Terraform to deploy and it maintains your infrastructure state in a file, we'll be using terraform-inventory to dynamically feed Ansible its list of target endpoints.

#### Git

We'll be making use of Git throughout these lessons and while you don't need in-depth knowledge of git and every flag for every option is has, you should be comfortable with cloning, tracking, and commiting your changes. If you need a little help along the way there are tons of resources online that can get you through anything that may come up. As I mentioned above, Terraform and Ansible's files can be version controlled, giving you more control over your infrastructure. This type of functionality is also extremely helpful when making changes and testing since you'll be able to run tests on different versions of your infrastructure by specifying a version of a terraform module or ansible role.

The repos supplied in this book will be coming from [Github](https://github.com), but if you prefer, you can clone the repos and move them over to another git service like [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). It really is personal preference, but please keep in mind that specifying your module and role sources can very slightly depending on which service you use.

#### Terraform-inventory

Terraform-inventory is a dynamic inventory script used to pull resource information from Terraform's state file and outputs it in a way that Ansible can use to target specific hosts for during the execution of playbooks. This is a very simplistic explanation of what's going on but for now it's really all you need to know. 


## Getting our lab setup

We're going to be using a Droplet with Ubuntu 16.04 x64 (Xenial Xerus) as our controller machine from which we will be running our tools. If you're more comfortable with another Linux/BSD distribution, or macOS on your laptop then feel free to use it, but be sure that you can run at least one of the following in order to support Ansible:

* Python 2.6 or 2.7
* Python 3.5 or higher

For more information about system requirements, head over to http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html
  
With that out of the way, let's get started. If you don't already have a DigitalOcean account, start questioning your life choices, then head over to https://www.digitalocean.com/ and sign up. Once you've completed that quick process you'll see your accounts main page.

If this is a new account, or you just haven't set up your SSH key on your DigitalOcean account, I recommend you set it up using the instructions in the following tutorial then continue on with this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-ssh-keys-with-digitalocean-droplets

Go ahead and select **Create Droplet**. On the next page you'll see quite a few configuration options for your Droplet. We're going to select the following options:

* Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit
* 1gb standard size
* the data center of your choice
* enabled private networking
* enable backups
* user data
* monitoring
* SSH keys (if you have one set up)
* Droplet name of your choice
* a quantity of 1

You'll notice a text area open up when you select the option for *user data*. We're going to copy-paste this script inside to allow the cloud-init service to install Python 2.7, pip, git, zip, Terraform, terraform-inventory, and Ansible. Just remember to set your desired username and your public SSH key.

```yaml
#cloud-config

users:
  - name: <username>
    groups: sudo
    shell: /bin/bash
    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
    ssh-authorized-keys:
      - <enter_public_key_here>

package_upgrade: true

packages:
  - python
  - python-pip
  - git
  - zip

runcmd:
  - [curl, -o, /tmp/terraform.zip, "https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.11.3/terraform_0.11.3_linux_amd64.zip"]
  - [unzip, -d, /usr/local/bin/, /tmp/terraform.zip]
  - [curl, -L, -o, /tmp/terraform-inventory.zip, "https://github.com/adammck/terraform-inventory/releases/download/v0.7-pre/terraform-inventory_v0.7-pre_linux_amd64.zip"]
  - [unzip, -d, /usr/local/bin/, /tmp/terraform-inventory.zip]
  - [pip, install, -U, pip, ansible]
```

The Droplet is going to be up and running pretty quickly, but give the commands you pasted in some time to complete execution. You can always look in on */var/log/cloud-init-output.log* to see where it stands, or just shell into the Droplet and check to see if the ansible command is available yet since it's the last package installed. If you want to install all of the individual pieces of software manually, you absolutely can. Terraform and terraform-inventory are both just Go binaries that need to placed within your $PATH. As for ansible, I prefer installing it using pip over the system package manager since it stays up to date as well as being able to install within a virtualenv.
