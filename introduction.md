# Introduction

How do I scale and grow my infrastructure for my business?

## What Will You Learn From This Book?

Maybe you're convinced that computers are always broken and we should all become alpaca farmers.

the silver lining is that we can build a highly available, secure solution with data redundancy in place. 

In this book we are going to architect solutions to prevent common issues. By the end, your infrastructure will stay online, scale easily, be easier to troubleshoot, and secure.

The silver lining to the complicated realities of cloud computing is that it is possible to build a highly available, secure infrastructure with data redundancy. By the end of this book, you'll understand how.

More specifically, you'll learn how to run production-scale infrastructure successfully on DigitalOcean. In other words, you will have both the conceptual understanding and the hands-on skills to make sure your infrastructure will reliably stay online, your data will be secure, and it will be easy for you to scale out and troubleshoot problems.

(Want to know more about DigitalOcean and the authors of this book? That's in the next chapter. This chapter is about you.)

We based this book on the real world problems that our customers encountered and that we helped them solve. We'll outline infrastructure best practices and explain not just what those best practices are and how to implement them, but _why_ they prevent pain points and issues. Understanding the "why" will empower you to make the right decisions for your use case.

## Who Is This Book For?

This book is intended for anyone thinking about or facing issues with scaling and growing their infrastructure.

The main skill set you'll need to follow along is some familiarity with [the Linux command line](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/getting-started-with-linux), but many of the key takeaways will be framed at a high level and easy to understand and apply conceptually as well.

Each chapter includes code examples, and the accompanying repository deploys this book's sample infrastructure <!-- TODO: explain what's in the repo more accurately --> to give you a hands-on starting point as you follow along. At the same time, we'll also provide comprehensive technical explanations to make sure you understand the reasoning behind our recommendations.

While we wrote this book with a single narrative in mind, we 

Because we know that you — our readers — will have varied levels of experience in different areas, 

## What Does This Book Cover?

This book is broken into five parts which contain a few chapters each, plus this introduction and a conclusion. You can see the structure in the table of contents on the previous page, too. <!-- TODO: make sure we generate a TOC -->

Parts 2 through 5 are the meat of the book. That's where we'll teach you how to prevent downtime, scale your infrastructure, keep your data safe, make it easy to troubleshoot issues, identify performance bottlenecks, and stay protected from security threats.

Before we can do that, we want to make sure that everyone  with the same foundation. That's what Part 1 is for.

Part 1, Background and Setup, consists of the first three chapters of the book. Chapter 1 gives some background on who we are and what DigitalOcean is. Chapter 2 explains the problems people encounter with cloud computing and our solutions to them (i.e. an overview of Parts 2 through 5). Chapter 3 walks you through the tools we'll use to build the infrastructure described in this book, and how to get your environment set up to follow along.

Let's get started.
